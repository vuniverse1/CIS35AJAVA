Jason Vu Java Programming 35A Exercise 2 
Design
Variables
(String) variables to track name and dates of departure and arrival, in child classes, cargo type, loading type, cruise type
(double) track ticket price variable in child class
(int) variables to track year, capacity, length, width, height
Input
        Hardcode values using methods or in constructor
                ships[0].setHeight(100);
ships[1] = new Ship("La Vida", 1976, 1000, 500, 500, 50,"03 - 04 - 2022", "03 - 05 - 2022");




Processing
Calculate the surface area of ship
Length times width
Override method in cruise ship bc there are multiple floors
        Length times width times numOfFloors


Printing
        Print the ships in array using for loop
for(int i = 0; i < ships.length; i++) {
                        System.out.printf("\n");
                        ships[i].print(); }
