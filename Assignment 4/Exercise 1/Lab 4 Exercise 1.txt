PART 1
Design
Variables
(double) we need variables to track savingBalance
static (double) variable to track the annualInterestRate, static so it is available for all objects and class
Input
        Hardcode values using method
                saver1.setSavingsBalance(2000);
                saver2.setSavingsBalance(3000);
                SavingsAccount.modifyInterestRate(.04);




Processing
Calculate the monthly interest
savingsBalance += savingsBalance * (annualInterestRate/12);
Calculate the deposit and withdrawal
        savingsBalance (+)(-)= savingsAmount;


Printing
        Print the balances, call method
System.out.printf("\nYour new balance is $%.2f", saver1.getSavingsBalance());






Test Output
Testing for 4% interest rate


Your new balance is $2006.67
Your new balance is $3010.00
-----------------------------------------------
Testing for 5% interest rate


Your new balance is $2015.03
Your new balance is $3022.54
















PART 2
Design
Variables
        VARIABLES ARE INHERITED FROM PARENT CLASS - use super() in constructor
(double) we need variables to track savingBalance
static (double) variable to track the annualInterestRate, static so it is available for all objects and class
Input
        Hardcode values using methods
                saver1.setSavingsBalance(2000.00);
                saver2.deposit(800);
                saver1.withdraw(500);




Processing
* Inherit parent class methods
* Overrride method for calculating monthly interest
if(getSavingsBalance() > 10000) {  //if return savings balance exceeds 10k
                modifyInterestRate(.1); //interest rate is 10%
        }
        else {
                modifyInterestRate(0.04); //else interest rate stays at 4%
                }
        super.calcMonthlyInterest(); //then calculate the monthly interest rate
}




Printing
        Print the balances, call method
System.out.printf("\nYour new balance is $%.2f", saver1.getSavingsBalance());






Test Output
saver1 initial balance = $3000, deposit $12000 and $100, withdraw $9750
Saver2 initial balance = $2000, deposit $500 and withdraw $180
After deposit
Your new saver1 balance is $15225.83
Your new saver 2 balance is $2508.33
After withdrawal
Your new saver1 balance is $5475.83
Your new saver2 balance is $2328.33
